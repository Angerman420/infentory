# infentory
An inventory of example systems for the infretis software.

These examples are not directly runnable out of the box, as initial paths are not provided.

One strategy to generate initial paths is via the [inftools](https://github.com/infretis/inftools/tree/main) `inft generate_zero_paths` script. This generates paths in the [0-] and [0+] ensembles. You can then follow the initial-path procedure in the [puckering tutorial](https://github.com/infretis/infretis/tree/main/examples/gromacs/puckering#step-3-retis) to push the system over the barrier using path-sampling.
