### TODO
* [x] reduce load path size
* [x] upload to infentory
* [ ] adapt inft plot_order
* [x] make scripts for visualization
* [x] fix lammpstrj processor
* [x] fix xyz processor?
* [ ] also adapt puckering exercise for cosy; exactly the same as here but with gromacs. Only production md run and path sampling, then visualize
* [x] move puckering and water dissociation README.md to infentory
* [ ] fix installation after moving to infentory
### Aloha üëã
In this session, we will study the autoionization of water using **path sampling**. The main outcomes of this simulation allow us to

* calculate üñ•Ô∏è exactly how often water dissociates into H3O+ and OH-
* and visualize üëÄ how this chemical reaction actually happens

An essential ingredient of path sampling is using molecular dynamics (MD) to make the atoms and molecules wiggle around and react. As an introduction to the &infin;RETIS method you will therefore perform the following steps:

* 1Ô∏è‚É£ Perform an MD simulation using [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/#nogo)
* 2Ô∏è‚É£ Perform a path sampling simulation on this system with [&infin;RETIS](https://github.com/infretis/infretis) + LAMMPS
* 3Ô∏è‚É£ See and learn how water dissociates at the molecular scale üîé

### Step 0: Installation
Open a terminal üíª

If you don't already have conda or mamba:

```bash
curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh -b
```

Close and then re-open the terminal. You should now see **(base)** in the lower left of your screen.

Download python and lammps:

```bash
mamba create --name cosy_24 python==3.11 lammps
```

Install infretis, and the exercise files.
```bash
mamba activate cosy_24
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/infretis/infretis.git@cosy_24
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/infretis/inftools.git@main
git clone https://github.com/infretis/infentory.git
cd infentory/water_dissociation/lammps/
echo ========== We will perform the exercise from this folder ===============
```

### Step 1: MD with LAMMPS
Familiarize yourself with the files in the directory `lammps_input/`. Can you explain what these files contain?

Now, change to the `step1_md_run` directory and modify `lammp.input` to run an MD simulation at 300K for around 1 picosecond with a 0.5 fs timestep. We want to analyze some of the output, so write output with reasonable frequency, e.g. every 5 steps.

LAMMPS can be run with the command `lmp -i lammps.input`

üìà Does the system reach the desired temperature?

Animate the trajectory by opening the .dump file in Avogadro.

```bash
# Download Avogadro
wget https://github.com/OpenChemistry/avogadrolibs/releases/download/1.99.0/Avogadro2-x86_64.AppImage¬†~/
chmod +x ~/Avogadro2-x86_64.AppImage
# Run Avogadro
~/Avogadro2-x86_64.AppImage
```
Use the `animation tool` and click the `dynamic bonding` checkbox. You can rotate and zoom with the `navigation tool`. Do you see anything interesting? üîé 

We will now investigate the value of the order parameter.

```bash
inft recalculate_order -toml infretis.toml -traj md_run.dump -format 'lammpsdump'
gnuplot -e "plot 'order_rec.txt' with linespoint;" -p
```

Values up to around 1.5 mean we have only water present (the largest O-H bond length of all water molecules). Values greater than 1.5 tell us we have one OH- and one H3O+ present (the shortest distance between the OH- oxygen and H3O+ hydrogen).

Does the value of the order parameter during the simulation make sense with your conclusions from visualizing the trajectory? 


### Step 2: Path sampling with &infin;RETIS + LAMMPS
You now know how to run an MD simulation and calculate the order parameter. This is what &infin;RETIS does under the hood; a single Monte Carlo (MC) step with &infin;RETIS will run a LAMMPS simulation given some initial configuration and calculate the order parameter. If this trajectory meets the ensemble criterion we may accept and add it to our sampled states. If not we resample the old trajectory. So in path sampling, we combine both MC and MD in a hybrid approach. We need to do these steps repeatedly, which can take some time. Therefore we start the infretis simulation now. 

Navigate to the `step2_infretis` folder and fire off `infretisrun -i infretis.toml`.

‚èÆÔ∏è At this point, reviewing the main outcomes of a path sampling simulation may be useful to remind yourself why we are doing this.

Open a new terminal, run `mamba activate cosy_24`, and navigate to the same directory.

We may now start visualizing the results as infretis produces them.



### Step 3: Analysis of the results
Interested reader: This is a reproduction of the work in cite pnas?

```bash
inft trjcat -out traj.pdb -traj trash/reactive/traj.txt -topology test_reaxff_water/initial.xyz -format lammpsdump -centersel "index 78"
inft trjcat -out traj.pdb -traj traj.txt -topology ../../../gromacs_input/topol.tpr -centersel "element C" -selection "index 0 to 15"
